      <h1>Notice of Privacy Practices</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Effective Date: January 1, 2025 &nbsp;|&nbsp; Greater ATL Health — Lyna Ashu, FNP-C<br />
        <em>THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.</em>
      </p>

      <div class="legal-box">
        <p>We are required by law to maintain the privacy of your protected health information (PHI), provide you with this Notice, and follow the terms described here.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>Greater ATL Health is a solo telehealth practice operated by Lyna Ashu, FNP-C, a board-certified Family Nurse Practitioner licensed in the State of Georgia. We are a "covered entity" under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).</p>

      <h2>How We Use and Disclose Your Health Information</h2>
      <p>We use and share your protected health information (PHI) to provide care, run our practice, and as required or permitted by law:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> We use your health information to provide, coordinate, and manage your care — including sharing relevant information with pharmacies, labs, and specialist providers you are referred to.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment:</strong> We may use PHI to process payment for services, including collecting self-pay amounts and issuing receipts or superbills.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare Operations:</strong> We may use your information for quality improvement, staff training, and practice administration — all subject to HIPAA safeguards.</li>
        <li><strong>Required by Law:</strong> We will disclose PHI when required by federal, state, or local law — including reporting to public health authorities, law enforcement, or when ordered by a court.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergencies:</strong> We may disclose PHI to avert a serious and imminent threat to your health or safety or the health or safety of others.</li>
        <li><strong>Appointment Reminders:</strong> We may contact you by phone, email, or text to remind you of appointments or provide information about your care.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Uses and Disclosures Requiring Your Authorization</h2>
      <p>We will not use or disclose your PHI for purposes other than those described above without your written authorization, except as required by law. You may revoke your authorization in writing at any time, except to the extent we have already acted in reliance on it.</p>
      <p>Specifically, we will only use or disclose your PHI for the following purposes with your explicit written authorization:</p>

        <li>Marketing communications</li>
        <li>Sale of your health information</li>
        <li>Psychotherapy notes (if applicable)</li>
        <li>Any other use or disclosure not described in this Notice</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your Rights Regarding Your Health Information</h2>

        <li><strong>Right to Request Restrictions:</strong> You may request restrictions on how we use or disclose your PHI. We are not required to agree, but will comply with restrictions we do agree to.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Confidential Communications:</strong> You may request that we communicate with you about health matters in a specific way or location (e.g., by email only).</li>
        <li><strong>Right to a Paper Copy:</strong> You may request a paper copy of this Notice at any time, even if you agreed to receive it electronically.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Breach Notification:</strong> If a breach of your unsecured PHI occurs, you have the right to be notified in accordance with federal law.</li>
